# List of works we should do in code
# TODO Just attack if the map is small (categorize all nodes in inner category)
# TODO How to and When should we attack? In straight line or all together (categorize all nodes in inner category)?
# TODO Define a way to transfer power of one edge node to another edge node
# TODO If at the of path that we are going to discover, is no enemy, don't send all power, just send 1 power.
# TODO Build a list of adjacent enemies and calculate the minimum power needed to win the fight
